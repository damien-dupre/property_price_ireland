Introdution
==========================

To acquire a property is one of the most important achievement that individuals are seeking. It provides not only a housing security but also the feeling of being a landowner. However the access to the status of landowner is complicated because buying a property is the most expensive spending of in a lifetime. For this reason understanding the factors which are explaining how property prices evolve is a necessity.
